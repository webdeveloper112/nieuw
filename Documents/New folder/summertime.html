  <h1>Summer-time</h1>
  <div>
  <p>Summer is the warmest season of the year, falling between spring and autumn.<br>
    Temperatures over the period differ based upon the location on the Earth; regions near the equator
    <br> are typically warmer than those lying near the poles. 
    This is because, due to the curve of the Earth, these places receive the most sunlight.<br>
     The areas around the Earth’s poles also have ice, which reflect a lot of the sun’s rays.<br>
      The summer solstice occurs when the sun passes directly above the equator because of the tilt of the Earth. <br>
    When the seasons are based on the Earth’s position in relation to the sun, it is called astronomical summer.<br>
     In the Northern Hemisphere,astronomical summer happens on or around June 21.<br> 
    The North Pole is tilted at the greatest angle toward the sun at this time.  </p>
